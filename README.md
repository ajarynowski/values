Introduction. 
This study examines the relationship between social values and the control of the COVID-19 pandemic in selected European countries during the early months of 2020. 
Methods.
Utilizing epidemiological data, including starting and controlled reproduction rates (R0(t)), and social values' dimensions based on Schwartz's framework, we uncover significant associations by linear regressions.
Results. 
Our findings reveal that highly hierarchical societies with a strong focus on maximizing individual utility (affective autonomy) are less successful in controlling the spread of the virus. Conversely, societies with interconnected (embedded) structures appear to be more effective in disease control. Our discussion acknowledges the complexity of distinguishing between natural disease patterns and control efforts.

Conclusions. 
This study underscores the substantial influence of social values on disease control in Europe. It emphasizes the need to consider social contexts when evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation strategies on an international scale. While recognizing the potential role of confounding variables such as healthcare capacity, our research suggests that analysing outbreak dynamics across countries can provide insights into not only why some nations fare better but also how to combat future disease spread effectively.
